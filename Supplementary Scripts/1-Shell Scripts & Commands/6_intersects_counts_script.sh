# "Description:"
#   This script takes the RepeatMasker bed file and a gene annotation bed file and counts, for each nLTR insertion
#   (e.g., L1, SINE), how many gene features it intersects. It is used for genic insertion analyses with
#   either protein coding genes (PC) or cancer gene orthologs (CGOs).
#
#   Requirements:
#     - TE_file: RepeatMasker annotations converted to bed (e.g., Genus_species.bed)
#     - gene_file: bed annotation containing only PC genes or only CGOs (e.g., Genus_species_PCgenes.bed or Genus_species_CGOs.bed)
#     - Both inputs should be coordinate-sorted
#
#   Core operation:
#     - Intersections are computed with: bedtools intersect -a TE_file_asterisks_removed -b "${gene_file}" -sorted -c
#       The -c flag appends a count column giving the number of overlapping gene features per TE record.
#       Records with count > 0 are considered genic insertions for the corresponding gene set.
#
#   Output:
#     - For each species, results are saved to a dedicated subdirectory in a file named as Genus_species.txt
#       (e.g., Ovis_aries.txt)
#
#     - This file has the following structure showing the number of active nLTR Insertions within either PC genes or CGOs
#
#   Notes:
#     - Version differences in awk and bedtools may affect behavior. To reproduce our results exactly, use the same versions as in this study.
#     - Divergence is taken from column 7; element lengths are recalculated as (end â€“ start) and stored in column 10.
#	  - This script is designed to submit as a job array on slurm
